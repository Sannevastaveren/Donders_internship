# Donders_internship

## Small introduction 
To analyse this object space task a video of the rat exploring the objects in an arena and the neuronal activity of the ratâ€™s cortex are recorded simultaneously. With this information the location and amount of time spent there can be calculated using a tracker and can be further analysed by looking into the spiking activity of neurons at these locations. However, these videos can be long and large, and the neuronal data is not aligned with the video. 
Therefore, a process that includes video compression, behavioural tracking and synchronization with neuronal activity needs to be implemented and automated. In this repository you can find the scripts I have written to achieve this goal.

## Where to find what:
### Notebooks:
All Google colab notebooks I have used over the course of my internship:
- Stage_mini : Notebook with the deeplabcut code
- Synchronization: Notebook dedicated to the methods for synchronization, contains LED and Timestamp synchronization code as well as ADC channel recognition

### Data:
Nothing for now but will contain some example data and analysis results

### Graphs:
Nothing for now but will contain analysis graphs and other pictures relating to results that can be used in the paper
